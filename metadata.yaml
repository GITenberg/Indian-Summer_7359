description: "Indian Summer is an 1886 novel by William Dean Howells. Though it was\
  \ published after The Rise of Silas Lapham, it was written before The Rise of Silas\
  \ Lapham. The setting for this novel was inspired by a trip Howells had recently\
  \ taken with his family to Europe.\nHowells was a realist writer who wanted “his\
  \ characters to be honest, ordinary people, as he might find in his strata of society,\
  \ flawed and well-meaning, good-hearted and self-effacing, bound by the conventions\
  \ and the restrictions of their day but quietly dreaming of a little local heroism\
  \ in their souls.”  All of this is encompassed in the character Theodore Colville.\n\
